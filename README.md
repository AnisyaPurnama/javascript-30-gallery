# JavaScript 30 Gallery

A starter repository for studying the [JavaScript 30](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/javascript-30) individually, there is a template project structure in [/projects](./projects) that you can copy-paste for each project you complete. To showcase your work you can build a portfolio gallery in the main [./index.html](./index.html) file, creating a thumbnail and link for each project you've included in this repo.

Are you looking to practice your collaboration with the JS 30? Head over to the [javascript-30-starter](https://github.com/hackyourfuturebelgium/javascript-30-starter) for a single-project repo with automated documentation and testing when a new PR is created to the main branch.

## Getting Started

This repository comes with some nice extras like testing, documentation and CI, but in it's heart it's just an HTML/CSS/JS website boilerplate.

### Development

To run this project locally you will need to open `index.html` in your browser using a local server. LiveServer, `http-server`, `study-lenses`, or any other local static server will work.

### Deployment

Push your changes, turn on GitHub pages, that's all!

When your project is deployed to GitHub pages there will be buttons rendered at the top of your page to validate your HTML, CSS, accessibility and spelling, plus a link back to the project repository.

### Installing Dependencies

There are no dependencies needed to run the website, everything is prepared to work with vanilla JavaScript. However, if you want to run tests or if you want to generate documentation for your project you will need to install the development dependencies:

- `npm install`

### Testing

After installing the dev dependencies you can start writing and running tests for your .js files. Careful! In this project starter you can only test code that does not use the DOM, so only the `/logic` functions will be testable. You can run the tests in a single `.spec.js` using the VSCode debugger. Open the spec file you want to run, open the debugger pane, select the "current .spec.js file" option, then start debugging!
